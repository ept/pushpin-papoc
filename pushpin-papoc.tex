\section{Introduction}

\section{Bullet Points}

\begin{itemize}
    \item programming for deliberately distributed systems introduces new challenges
    \item how this environment different?
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item no single source of truth, no single authority
	    \item devices get out of sync
	    \item connectivity is non-boolean
	    \item changes can come from anywhere at any time
    \end{itemize}
    \item project goals
    \begin{itemize}
        \item highly polished end-user software to be accessible to users
        \item written with mainstream languages \& platforms to be accessible to developers
        \item software for the long now -- no infrastructure to decay
    \end{itemize}
    \item how to rationalize all this?
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item FRP, for its easily reasoned-about loop: 
	    \begin{itemize}
			 \item transform a document functionally into an application view
			 \item create events in the application that trigger state updates
			 \item record \& broadcast state updates to peers
		\end{itemize}
	    \item many nested \& linked documents, each with their own render function
	    \begin{itemize}
		    \item a text note, a chat window, a user profile, a canvas
		\end{itemize}
	    \item store all local changes in append-only logs, distribute those logs to other interested peers
	    \item use cryptographic functions to produce self-validating data
	\end{itemize}
    \item what works, what's not working so well?
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item FRP render loop works great -- taking a functional transform of a document state to application view means never worrying about where the update came from or how to render it
	    \item storing \& distributing append-only logs is very simple and robust
	    \item peer-to-peer networking is highly problematic
	    \begin{itemize}
		    \item webrtc (not very good, requires centralized assets)
		    \item DHTs (reliability, privacy)
		    \item centralized services (fragility)
		    \item router configuration issues
		\end{itemize}
	    \item much performance work has been done
	    \begin{itemize}
		    \item architect to separate render \& computation of CRDT operations
		\end{itemize}
	    \item conflict resolution surprisingly unproblematic
	    \item merge \& collaboration UX is largely unexplored (could show a pixelpusher slide \& briefly explain problems)
	    \item what kind of identity, privacy, sharing features are important / feasible here?
	    \item html is a pretty rough application development platform
	    \item no real mobile support
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item what's the cross-platform story?
	    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item conclusions
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item frp + crdt = pretty good
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
