PushPin paper
=============

This repository contains the LaTeX source of the following paper:

> Peter van Hardenberg and Martin Kleppmann.
> [PushPin: Towards Production-Quality Peer-to-Peer Collaboration](https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/pushpin-papoc20.pdf).
> 7th Workshop on Principles and Practice of Consistency for Distributed Data (PaPoC 2020), April 2020.
> [doi:10.1145/3380787.3393683](https://doi.org/10.1145/3380787.3393683)

Note the commit history makes it look as though all commits were made by Martin,
when in fact the paper was jointly written by Peter and Martin. Overleaf's sync to GitHub is weird.
